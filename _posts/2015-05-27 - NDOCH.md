It's been a while!

After our first session in February, we took a step back to see how we might better schedule with and support Open PGH, the local Code For America brigade. To that end, we are happy to announce that our next session will be integrated with OpenPGH's hosting of the **National Day of Civic Hacking (NDOCH)**.
