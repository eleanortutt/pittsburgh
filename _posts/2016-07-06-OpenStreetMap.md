When | July, 6 2016, from 6-8 PM
Where | [Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, Lawrenceville](http://carnegielibrary.org/locations/lawrenceville/)
Contact	| [@MaptimePGH](http://twitter.com/maptimePGH), [pittsburgh@maptime.io](mailto:pittsburgh@maptime.io)
Thanks | [Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh](http://www.carnegielibrary.org/), and [OpenPGH](http://www.opgh.org)

Join us to learn about OpenStreetMap - the free and editable map of the world - and make your first edit. We'll meet at the Lawrenceville library for a quick introduction to the OpenStreetMap project, community, and editing tools. Then we'll split into groups and contribute to an improved map of Pittsburgh. Want to enjoy the summer sunshine? Map Lawrenceville using an app or pen and paper. Want to relax with AC & wifi? Dig into OpenStreetMap editing tools and help us plan for larger-scale imports. Either way, you'll be creating open geographic data for mapmakers everywhere while enjoying pizza from our friends at [CartoDB](http://www.cartodb.com/).

> #### 6:45 - Break into three groups to map

> * Map Lawrenceville community assets (outdoors)
> * Map Pittsburgh building footprints (indoors)
> * Do your own thing!
> 	* Work through the ID tutorial
