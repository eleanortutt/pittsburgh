Our first session will be at X at X:XXpm

We plan to provide a broad overview of the basics of digital mapping: geodata, map projections, data sources like Open Street Map, and some of the software and websites available.

It will be an informal gathering, and no prior experience is required! Bring a laptop or tablet to follow along.
