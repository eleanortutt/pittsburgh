***We're still working out the details of this session. Time of day, location, and RSVP info will be updated soon***

In this session we'll do a walkthrough of [MapWarper](http://mapwarper.net), an excellent online tool for georeferencing images of maps. 

**Georeferencing** means giving geographic attribites to non-geographic data. With MapWarper, we'll show how to take maps that are only stored as images (e.g., scans of historic maps), place them in the correct virtual geographic context, and view them on a web map.

We'll then turn everyone loose on the University of Pittsburgh's excellent [digital historic maps collection](http://digital.library.pitt.edu/maps/), which includes many historic maps of Pittsburgh.

*New to Maptime? New to mapping? **Maptime is geared for beginners, and the session will be interactive so that you have plenty of opportunities to learn!***
