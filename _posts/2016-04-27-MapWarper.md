When | April, 27 2016, from 6-8 PM
Where | [Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, East Liberty](http://carnegielibrary.org/locations/eastliberty/)
Contact	| [@MaptimePGH](http://twitter.com/maptimePGH), [pittsburgh@maptime.io](mailto:pittsburgh@maptime.io)
Thanks | [Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh](http://www.carnegielibrary.org/) and [OpenPGH](http://www.opgh.org)

In this session we'll do a walkthrough of [**MapWarper**](http://mapwarper.net), an excellent online tool for georeferencing images of maps. 

*Georeferencing* is the process of giving non-geographic data the geographic attributes it needs to be shown on a digital map. With MapWarper, we'll show how to take maps that are only stored as images (e.g., scans of historic maps), place them in the correct virtual geographic context, and view them online.

We'll then turn everyone loose on the University of Pittsburgh's excellent [digital historic maps collection](http://digital.library.pitt.edu/maps/), which includes many amazing but un-georeferenced historic maps of Pittsburgh.

See this ["urban scratch-off map"](http://chriswhong.github.io/urbanscratchoff/) for an example of a fun way to interact with georeferenced historic maps. With a good inventory of georeferenced historic local maps, we can work with [OpenPGH](http://www.opgh.org) to build something similar here!
