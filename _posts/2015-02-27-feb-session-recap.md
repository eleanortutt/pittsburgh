We had a great introductory session on February 19 at the Carnegie Museum. The slides from that meeting are available [here](http://www.maptime.io/pittsburgh/presentations/geo101).

We also got out and promoted the group at the Civic Tech Fair the coincided with Steel City Codefest the following Sunday.

It's been great starting out in such a prestigious location, and we hope to get back there in the future for another session.

There's been rumblings around creating a ***Pittsburgh Pierogie Map*** for some time amongst the OpenPGH crew and its fearless leader, [Bob Gradeck](http://www.twitter.com/BobGradeck). For our next session, we're going to get it done! Or rather, **you** are going to get it done! We'll walk you through creating a web map: everything from raw data and basemaps to the Javascript (using [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/)!) and HTML.

New to Maptime and not quite sure what any of that written above means? Fear not! ***Maptime is geared for beginners, and the sessions are interactive so that you have plenty of opportunities to learn!***

Time and location details are still being sorted, but hopefully we can continue to take advantage of some more of the city's great institutional spaces like the Carnegie Museum in the future.
