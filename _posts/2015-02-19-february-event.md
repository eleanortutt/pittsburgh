The event will be held in the Ford-Mateer classroom at the Carnegie Museum in Oakland, which can be accessed through the portal entrance at the rear of the museum ([40.443060, -79.949607](https://www.google.com/maps/place/40%C2%B026%2735.0%22N+79%C2%B056%2758.6%22W/@40.44306,-79.949607,18z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0)). You can reach the portal entrance through the parking area behind the museum from the intersection of Forbes and Craig or you can walk from Schenley Drive by the right side of the Carnegie Libary to the parking area in rear.  Take a left before you reach the courtyard. After you pass through the portal entrance, the Ford-Mateer Classroom is the first classroom on the left after you pass through the glass double doors.

# Overview

Our interactive session will go over the basics of digital mapping within the context of using and editing Open Street Map (OSM)*. We will cover:

- geographic data types
- coordinate systems and projections
- geocoding, querying, and analysis concepts
- online and desktop tools available for handling geographic information

The goal is to provide a general overview of some core concepts, tools, and resources available to enable everyone to get started working independently with digitial maps, geographic data, and Open Street Map. The session will be interactive and informal, with lots of time to ask questions and digress!

If you have a chance prior to this meet-up, please create a free account for Open Street Map @ https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new - we will be using the online OSM editor "iD" for most of the session.

Remember, ***no prior experience is required*** and ***Maptime is always interactive***, so don't forget to bring your laptop or tablet!

*Please note: we've changed the agenda for the session slightly since we originally posted. We will be using only online web tools (though we will likely use Mapbox Studio and QGIS in future sessions).

Hope to see you there!
