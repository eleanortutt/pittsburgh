###Overview###

Our talk/demonstration/interactive session will cover the basics of digital mapping:

- geographic data types
- coordinate systems and projections
- open source software and mapping websites available
- geocoding, querying, and analysis concepts

The goal is to provide some basic information and resources to enable folks to being working with geographic data and digital maps on their own. Remember, **no prior experience is required** and Maptime is always interactive, so **don't forget to bring your laptop or tablet**! 

If you do plan on bringing a laptop or tablet and want to follow along, try to download and install the following free software ahead of time:

- [QGIS](http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) (available for Windows, OSX, and Android)
- [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio) (available for Windows and OSX)

If you'd like help with installation, come at 6:30pm prior to the session and we'll be there to help.

Hope to see you there!
