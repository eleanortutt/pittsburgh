Maptime Pittsburgh is official! We will be kicking-off with our first session in February 2015. The date and location are yet to be finalized - stay tuned.

In our first session, we plan to provide a broad overview of the basics of digital mapping: geodata, map projections, data sources like Open Street Map, and some of the software and websites available.

It will be an informal gathering, and no prior experience is required!
