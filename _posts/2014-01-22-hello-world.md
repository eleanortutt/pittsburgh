Maptime Pittsburgh is official!

We will be kicking-off with our first session in February 2015. The date and location are yet to be finalized - stay tuned.

In our first session, we plan to provide a broad overview of digital mapping and geographic information systems and. No prior experience is required! We will cover basics, with demos to illustrate examples, in a way that someone with no or little experience can pick up.

More details to come once a time and place is set!
