Maptime Pittsburgh is official!

We will be kicking-off with our first session in February 2015. The date and location are yet to be finalized - stay tuned.

In our first session, we plan to provide a broad overview of the world of digital mapping and geographic information systems (GIS). **No prior experience is required!** We will cover the basics and provide a few demos. Our goal for the first session is for folks to walk away with basic knowledge, some tools, and some learning resources to support their own pursuits. 

More details to come once a time and place is set!
